** Internet Protocol **
HTTPS: Hypertext transfer Protocol Secure ,Port No. 443 --> encrypted message
HTTP: Hypertext transfer protocl , port no 80, Application Layer (Layer7) --> not encrypted meassage
TLS/SSL: Transport Layer Security/ Secure Sockets Layer(SSL) --> HTTPS uses for encryption.
TCP:   Transfer Layer Protocol --> Layer 4 transport layer --> Port 22
UDP:   User Datagram Protocol  ---> Port 53 --> video streaming, and gaming.
Ports 20 and 21:  FTP is used to transfer files between a client and a server.
Port 22:  Secure Shell ( ssh) is one of several tunneling protocols used to build secure network connections.


** Network Layer Protocol **
IPsec: Internet Protocol Security.
--> set up encrypted, authenticated IP connections over a virtual private network.

ICMP: Internet Control Message Protocol 
---> reports errors and provides status updates
router is unable to deliver a packet, it will send an ICMP message back to packet's source

IGMP: Internet Group Management Protocl


** Routers Protocol **

BGP --> Border Gateway Protocol --> Application Layer Protocol--> used to broadcast which IP addresses they control.
EIGRP --> Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP) identifies distances between routers. E
OSPF: The Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) protocol calculates the most efficient network routes based on a variety of factors, including distance and bandwidth.

RIP: The Routing Information Protocol (RIP) is an older routing protocol that identifies distances between routers. RIP is an application layer protocol.



Port 3389: Remote Desktop Protocol  ( RDP ) enables users to connect to their desktop computers from another device remotely.

Port 2049 : NFS ( Network file sharing/system) protocol is use for file sharing over the network

ICMP ( Internet control message protocol ) :  typically used to provide error reporting on network. 

Icmp has no concept of ports as tcp and udp do.
